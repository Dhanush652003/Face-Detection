Introduction:
Face detection is a fundamental computer vision task with numerous real-world applications, from security systems to augmented reality. This project harnesses the capabilities of OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, and Haar Cascade classifiers to create an efficient and accurate face detection system.

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to design a face detection system that can identify and locate human faces within images or video streams. It leverages Haar Cascade classifiers, a machine learning-based approach, to achieve robust and real-time face detection.

Key Features:

1)Real-time Detection: The project implements real-time face detection, allowing it to process video streams or live camera feeds for immediate face identification.

2)Accuracy: Haar Cascade classifiers are utilized for their high accuracy in detecting faces, making the system reliable in various conditions.

3)Multi-face Detection: The system is capable of detecting multiple faces within the same frame, providing versatility for different applications.

4)Efficiency: Haar Cascade-based face detection is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications even on modest hardware.

Technologies Used:

OpenCV: OpenCV serves as the core technology for image processing and Haar Cascade-based face detection.
